# NB Disk Reader

## What is this

This project contains many applications to generate libraries and applications, with their related unit-test applications.

## NBDiskReader

Utility to read/write and view various older disk formats. 

Ideally this will have commandline and UI functionality and support all formats for the various 8bit and 16bit computers.

## NBLibrary

All functionality will be included here, allowing for better reuse and smaller build times. Plus there is no reinventing the wheel.

## TestNBDiskReader

Unit testing for the disk reader

## TestNBLibrary

Unit testing for the library.
